Assignment:
Recreating the Google homepage to practice what I have learned.
It is based off this version of google: https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/

After assignment reflection (what I have learned):
-Use grid to organize each section of page (Seems to be common practice)
-Figure out how to properly organize html and css
-My page looks quite similar but lacks a bit of css because it isn't showing up
I think because of my formatting.
-This was fun, I think I will redo this project with 100% accuracy
